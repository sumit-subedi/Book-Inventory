# Book-Inventory

This project my simple approach to book inventory using django and google books api.

Admin can login to manage books in inventory and user can login to register store and add book to the store from inventory.

## Admin 
## User Name: admin
## password: admin

Admin can choose books from booksapi. For this I have used jquery to load data from api, because I thought processing the data from backend was not necessary.
Both admin and user will use same login form to login.

To run this project go to the folder bookInventory where manage.py is present and run the command in the command prompt or terminal.
```
python manage.py runserver
```

# To do:
### 1.Let users select book from google api directly.
### 2.Improve design.
